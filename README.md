## Architecture

SynLearn's architecture is modular and comprises several key components:

- **Frontend (React.js)**: The user interface is crafted using React, managing the user experience, state, and interactions.
- **Smart Contracts (Solidity)**: Core business logic and data persistence are managed by smart contracts ensuring that all actions (e.g., user registration, certificate issuance) are immutable.
- **Blockchain (Ganache/Ethereum)**: Deployed smart contracts operate on a blockchain network, ensuring decentralized data storage.
- **Certificate Generation (HTML Canvas)**: Utilizes HTML Canvas to create visually appealing, dynamic certificates that reflect course completions.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
SynLearn/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/                   # React frontend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/               # Static assets (images, HTML, course data)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # React source code
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js            # Main React component
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.js         # Configuration file for smart contract addresses
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ contracts/        # Auto-generated smart contract ABIs
â”œâ”€â”€ build/contract/           # Compiled contract ABIs (e.g., Authentication.json)
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/                # Solidity smart contracts (*.sol)
â”œâ”€â”€ truffle-config.js         # Truffle configuration for deployment
```

Each folder is purposefully structured to separate the frontend logic, blockchain contracts, and compiled artifacts, making the project easier to navigate and maintain.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm**: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **Truffle**: Install globally using npm.
- **Ganache**: A local blockchain emulator for Ethereum development.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ankush2201/CodeShasatra_Syndicate.git
   cd SynLearn
   ```

2. **Install Global Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

3. **Install Client Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start Local Blockchain**

   Launch Ganache (or your preferred local blockchain) to simulate the blockchain network.

5. **Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts**

   From the project root, execute:
   
   ```bash
   cd ..
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```

   This step compiles the Solidity contracts and deploys them, generating artifacts in the `build/contract` directory.

6. **Configure Contract Addresses**

   Update `client/src/config.js` with the addresses of the deployed contracts.

7. **Run the React Application**

   Start the client application:
   
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

   Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the platform.

## Smart Contracts

### Authentication.sol

- **Purpose**: Manages user registrations and logins.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `signUp`: Registers new users by storing personal details (first name, family name, password, and user type).
  - `nbrUsers`: Tracks the total number of registered users.

### Courses.sol (Course Certification)

- **Purpose**: Records course completions and certificate issuance.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Stores course completion data on the blockchain.
  - Generates a unique certificate record, ensuring that every issued certificate is verifiable.

The smart contracts ensure that all critical user interactions and course records are secure and immutable.

---

## Course Content Format

Courses in SynLearn are structured to allow easy scalability and modular updates:

- **course_1_meta.js**: Contains essential course metadata including title, author, description, and other related details.
- **course_1_qcm.js**: An array of quiz questions, each with multiple-choice answers and an indicator for the correct answer.

These files reside in:

```
client/public/datas/course_1/
```

This structure supports the addition of new courses without impacting the core functionality of the platform.

---

## Certificate Generation

Certificate generation in SynLearn is dynamic and visually appealing:

- **HTML Canvas**: Utilizes the HTML Canvas API to create certificates on-the-fly.
- **Customizable Templates**: Certificates include a background image, course name, user details, and date.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Each certificate can be associated with a unique hash or transaction ID, ensuring it can be validated against blockchain records.

This process guarantees that every certificate is both unique and verifiable.

---

## UI/UX References

The design of SynLearn is supported by detailed mockups and design references:

- **Certification.pptx**: Contains visual mockups for the certificate generation process.
- **Home Page.pptx**: Provides design guidelines for the homepage and overall user experience.

These assets ensure that the platform remains user-friendly and aesthetically consistent.
